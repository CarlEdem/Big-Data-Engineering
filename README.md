Inflation Data Analysis using Databricks platform 


This project is an attempt to understand inflation on a small scale. We picked three distinct
categories of data from U.S. Bureau of Labor & Statistics and one category of data from Yahoo
Finance and performed analysis on them.
We selected this subject due to our collective observation of inflation's significant influence
on a worldwide scale, which could rank as one of the most discussed issues in 2023,
alongside AI. Our aim is to comprehend the inflation trend more deeply on Gasoline, weekly
and hourly earnings, and all items in the U.S. Additionally, we are intrigued to explore
whether there's any correlation between the inflation of goods and services and the Bitcoin
cryptocurrency market.

The flow of the project was designed using the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture.
